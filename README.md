##### Note before starting : Make sure you have a character you can use "/marry track" on, and put it in the spot that you want to level in.
##### Dont forget to set party

How to start :
1) Open the bot with admin (run as administrator)
2) Open up the game first (mu client)
3) Disable chat and whispers until your chat settings look like this : ![image](https://github.com/frostbear12/elite_mu_bot/assets/84524648/cb4872db-9efe-4279-8ac2-7e97926e4ad1)
4) Open mu client settings and configure in options : Resolution, Font Size so they match the picture : ![image](https://github.com/frostbear12/elite_mu_bot/assets/84524648/d226dbeb-89e2-4340-8494-dd8bf3c1c73f)
5) In the bot window:
  * Select Class from dropdown
  * Enter your grand reset count
  * You can select phase ( optional ) by default leave it at start.
6) Now close all the unnecessary windows in mu client (stats, quests, inventory...) leave the screen open.
7) In the bot : Press "Center Window", and select the Mu Client. ( you will have 5 seconds to select the client).
8) Press "Start Script" and enjoy.

Extra notes : Restart/Pause are still buggy, so be aware of using them. They tend to fail... a lot.


Enjoy :)
