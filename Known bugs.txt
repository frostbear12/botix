# Create a double check for resets.
 - before reseting, press "C" to disable the window.
	- Execute the reset
	- Before exiting the reset:
		- open "c" 
		- check if level is "1"
			if not, then, run the "reset" script again without the "start helper"

# Check the coordinates of the dungeon2
	- if the coordinates are 231, then stop faster

# Make a check that the "C" window  is open
- fixed

# Make sure that "Enter" is actually pressed, before starting to type (add stats, move to dungeon, marry track)
- fixed

# On lorencia monster hunt if too far 186+ , then move back a bit
